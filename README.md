- After you run the project , it'll automatically get the [monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/) website .
- It'll even Accept all the cookie's from the website you don't even need to do that.
- The program will ask for YOUR [monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/) `username` and `password` to log into your account . 
- After that it'll ask for the delay time (in seconds) while `Typing`
- Give the delay time according to your usual typing speed and then increase it as you go or else the score will not be saved . Example (0.1 then , 0.005 , 0.0005 ...)
